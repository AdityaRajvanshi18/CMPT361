**Introduction to Computer Graphics**

All the code in this class was written in C++ and OpenGL.

These were the following projects:

Fruit Tetris - Writing the logic and the code for drawing a tetris board with moving pieces and a game timer. The game is a cross between matching fruits (like candy crush) and tetris, where the aim is to fit pieces to complete rows but also to have consecutive coloured cubes match as well.

Fruit Tetris 3D - This project implemented the same game from above but using a 3D game world rather than 2D. The player must control the camera and the arm to place pieces into the board. The code for rendering had to be entirely re-written, as did a lot of the game logic. 

Raytracer - An ambitious project where the interaction of light with objects was simulated. These objects have different surface textures, reflectivity, sizes, etc. The scenes also have multiple light sources that have their own colour and positions. Physics based rendering was implemented to simulate correctly placed shadows and reflections up to 5 levels deep. The user can toggle which settings they would like to use and how many levels of reflections they would like to render.
